		<h1>How we start this?</h1>
		<p>
			With a Don-Quixote-style professional idealism, Will McAvoy started to patner with his former collegue MacKenzie McHale to build a new news show at ACN- The News Night. 
			This show focus not on shallow, short-term human interest stories but on delivering coverage of important issues 
			and relevant matters that the American public should be fully informed on, especially in the voting booth.

		<h1>Philosophy</h1>
		<p>
			Hear our philosophy from the executive producer:<br>
			"Reclaiming the fourth estate. 
			Reclaiming journalism as an honorable profession. 
			A nightly newscast that informs a debate worthy of a great nation. 
			Civility, respect, and a return to what's important; 
			the death of bitchiness; 
			the death of gossip and voyeurism; 
			speaking truth to stupid.
			 No demographic sweet spot; 
			 a place where we all come together." -MacKenzie McHale<br>
