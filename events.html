		<h1>Tea Party Movement</h1>
		<p>
			The team covered the Tea Party candidates during the US Congressional mid-term elections. 
			Will revealed to the public that Koch brothers have bankrolled Tea Party candidates in excess of $40 million in the past 6 months.
			This means that the Tea Party wasn't a grassroots movement at all, they are not representing the voices of average Americans that were drowned out by lobbyists and special interests.

		<h1>Arab Spring Developments</h1>
		<p>
			The news team hired a local Egyptian stringer to report on Arab Spring developments. 
			On his way to get information from the local government, the stringer Kahlid got in Egyptian military custody and they were demanding an extortionate ransom.
			To protect Kahlid, our anchor Will paid for his release on his own. When employees in the office discovered this, they each gave Will a cheque to contribute.
